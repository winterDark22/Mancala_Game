# 🏆 Mancala AI Game  

A **Java-based Mancala game** built for **CSE 318 (Artificial Intelligence)** coursework.  
This project implements **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**, enabling AI-driven gameplay with different heuristics.  

## 🎮 Game Modes  
✅ **AI vs AI** – Two AI players compete using different heuristics.  
✅ **Human vs AI** – Play against an AI opponent with intelligent decision-making.  
✅ **Autoplay** – Simulated games where one player makes random moves, and AI uses Minimax.  

## 🛠️ How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Mancala-AI.git  
   cd Mancala-AI  
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java  
4. Run the game:
   ```bash
   java Main
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose a game mode and play.

## 🧠 AI Implementation  
✅ **Minimax Algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning** for optimal decision-making.  
✅ **Customizable heuristic evaluation** for testing different AI strategies.  
✅ **Adjustable search depth** for controlling AI complexity.
